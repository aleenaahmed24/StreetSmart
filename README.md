## Overview
StreetSmart is a pedestrian safety application that enhances sidewalk safety for pedestrians through user-reported hazards, color-coded accessibility and safe route navigation, while also providing city officials with data-driven repair plans.

## Breakdown of the features:
We integrated Google Maps API to suggest places near you and provide color-coded maps based on severity level. It generates directions with alternate routes if there was a hazard detected. There is also text-to-speech navigation so user can easily listen and follow as they walk.

The second tab is a reporting feature
