## Overview
StreetSmart is a pedestrian safety application that enhances sidewalk safety for pedestrians through user-reported hazards, color-coded accessibility and safe route navigation, while also providing city officials with data-driven repair plans.

## Why StreetSmart?
We created an application that seeks to address the lack of accessible and safe sidewalk infrastructure, particularly for individuals with physical impairments such as wheelchair users. Sidewalk hazards such as sidwalk damage, obstructive debris, or uneven pavement can hinder mobility and compromise the safety and independence of those with limited physical capabilities.  This issue not only affects day-to-day movement but also limits access to essential services, social opportunities, and overall quality of life for these individuals. Additionally, current systems for reporting sidewalk hazards often lack inclusivity and anonymity . This creates barriers for people with impairments to voice their concerns effectively, leaving their needs underserved. Local governments often face challenges in identifying and prioritizing repair work due to limited real-time and localized data on the extent and severity of such hazards.


## Breakdown of the features:
We integrated Google Maps API to suggest places near you and provide color-coded maps based on severity level. It generates directions with alternate routes if there was a hazard detected. There is also text-to-speech navigation so user can easily listen and follow as they walk.

There is a reporting feature for the user to report any hazard they encounter while walking. They can upload an image, location, indicate severity level and more. 

The user-reported data will append to our sidewalk hazards database and users have access to all hazard insights for their safety. City officials can refer to it to identify and prioritize which hazards to address and resolve. 

City officials can also generate actionable repair plans and an estimated budget to get started on repairing the hazards. 

## Our Solution
By enabling users—particularly those with physical impairments—to report hazards anonymously, and providing local city officials with data-driven insights for repairs, StreetSmart delivers a meaningful solution that promotes safer, more sustainable, and inclusive urban infrastructure. The platform effectively addresses critical social issues related to inclusivity, mobility, and public safety.
